# PJSIP for Android
This is the famous PJSIP library compiled for Android. For more information about the PJSIP library visit the developer site [here](http://www.pjsip.org/)

The current version of this library is 2.6.

# Reporting issues
Please contact the PJSIP team directly. I´m only compiling and publishing PJSIP for Android on JCenter.

# Integrated features
Nothing special. I´ve compiled it with all standard features and values BUT without video support and OpenSSL. As an extra feature I´ve added and activated WebRTC AEC.

If you need something special like video support or OpenSSL, drop me a message. On a good day I´ll maybe compile it for you ;-)
Or just do it on your own.

# Add library to your project
Just add this dependency to your project and you're good to go
```
dependencies {
    compile "de.d0pam1n:pjsip-for-android:2.6"
}
```
